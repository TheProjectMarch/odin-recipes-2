#Project: Recipes

The Odin Project's introductory project "Recipes". A basic HTML structured framework for a small recipe collection website.

The goal -- in this first segment - to showcase an understanding of, and proficiency in the basics of HTML and syntactic structuring of a website's content utilizing the primary basics of headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. An understanding of the boilerplate top level meta-structuring (head, meta tages, title, etc...) will be demonstrated as well.
